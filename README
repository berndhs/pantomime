Some code to experiment with Qt Gestures

The Qt Gesture feature as I found it for QML at this point (Sep 2, 2011)
seems awkward and possibly broken. Recognizing gestures is not too hard,
but it is not clear under what circumstances the gestures get delivered,
and to which objects.

This code tries to offer straightforward semantics about what is a gesture,
and which objects receive it.
